<p>A <b>winter storm</b> is an event in which the varieties of <a href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" title="Precipitation (meteorology)" class="mw-redirect">precipitation</a> are formed that only occur at low <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperatures</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ice_pellets" title="Ice pellets">sleet</a>, or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow <a href="/wiki/Ice" title="Ice">ice</a> to form (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Freezing_rain" title="Freezing rain">freezing rain</a>). In temperate continental <a href="/wiki/Climate" title="Climate">climates</a>, these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. Very rarely, they may form in summer, though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer, such as the summer of <a href="/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer" title="Year Without a Summer">1816</a> in the Northeast <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States of America</a>.</p>
