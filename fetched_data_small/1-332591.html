<p>A <b>thermometer</b> is a device that measures <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Temperature_gradient" title="Temperature gradient">temperature gradient</a>. A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb on a <a href="/wiki/Mercury-in-glass_thermometer" title="Mercury-in-glass thermometer">mercury-in-glass thermometer</a>) in which some physical change occurs with temperature, and (2) some means of converting this physical change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer).</p>
