<p><b>Lightning</b> is a sudden <a href="/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge" title="Electrostatic discharge">electrostatic discharge</a> during an <a href="/wiki/Electrical_storm" title="Electrical storm" class="mw-redirect">electrical storm</a> between <a href="/wiki/Electric_charge" title="Electric charge">electrically charged</a> regions of a <a href="/wiki/Thundercloud" title="Thundercloud" class="mw-redirect">cloud</a> (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between that cloud and another cloud (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Lightning_strike" title="Lightning strike"><i>strike</i></a> if it hits an object on the ground, and a <b>flash</b> if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>, and sound in the form of <a href="/wiki/Thunder" title="Thunder">thunder</a>. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.</p>
