<p>The <b>lunar phase</b> or <b>phase of the moon</b> is the shape of the illuminated (sunlit) portion of the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> as seen by an observer on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon <a href="/wiki/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbits</a> the Earth, according to the changing positions of the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> relative to the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. The Moon's rotation is <a href="/wiki/Tidal_locking" title="Tidal locking">tidally locked</a> by the Earth's gravity, therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth. This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit. Therefore, the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100% (<a href="/wiki/Full_moon" title="Full moon">full moon</a>) to 0% (<a href="/wiki/New_moon" title="New moon">new moon</a>). The <a href="/wiki/Lunar_terminator" title="Lunar terminator">lunar terminator</a> is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres. Each of the four "intermediate" lunar phases (see below) is roughly seven days (~7.4 days) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as <a href="/wiki/Shoemaker_(lunar_crater)" title="Shoemaker (lunar crater)">Shoemaker</a>, all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight, followed by 14.77 days of "night". (The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the "dark side", which is a misnomer. It receives just as much sunlight as the Earth-facing side âˆ’ actually slightly more, since the Earth never obscures the Sun from it.)</p>
